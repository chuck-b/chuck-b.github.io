excerpt: 'Simplified building models have gained in popularity as a result of their practical applications in model-based predictive control (MPC); however, these models require accurate parameter estimates in order to give meaningful results. To this end, this simulation-based study proposes a recursive parameter estimation methodology—the so-called Ensemble Kalman Filter—as a method for predicting effective resistance and capacitance values of an office space. Accuracy of the proposed methodology to predict the response of the simulated-building was studied. Results indicate that the proposed methodology resembles a promising approach to learn building physics in a self-adaptive manner using simple generic sensor/meter networks; lending itself to the controls practitioners.'

Simplified building models have gained in popularity as a result of their practical applications in model-based predictive control (MPC); however, these models require accurate parameter estimates in order to give meaningful results. To this end, this simulation-based study proposes a recursive parameter estimation methodology—the so-called Ensemble Kalman Filter—as a method for predicting effective resistance and capacitance values of an office space. Accuracy of the proposed methodology to predict the response of the simulated-building was studied. Results indicate that the proposed methodology resembles a promising approach to learn building physics in a self-adaptive manner using simple generic sensor/meter networks; lending itself to the controls practitioners.
