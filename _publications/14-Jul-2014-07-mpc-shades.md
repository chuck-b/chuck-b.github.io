title: "Model-based predictive control of window shades"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/14-Jul-2014-07-mpc-shades
excerpt: 'As architecture and engineering push the boundaries of what is possible with highlyglazed façades, the traditional approach of leaving shading control up to active occupants becomes a larger energy burden. Shades, if operated correctly, can provide substantial reductions both to the space conditioning loads of the building and its lighting use. Because of the delayed thermal response to solar gains, predictive controls are beneficial.'
