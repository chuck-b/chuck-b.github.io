excerpt: 'This paper presents a building performance simulation-based investigation to better understand the energy and comfort performance benefits of early detection of common sensor and actuator faults. Five types of air-handling unit faults and four types of zone-level faults were implemented to the energy management system application of the building performance simulation tool EnergyPlus. During 50-year simulation periods, the faults were randomly permitted to affect 75 different components of an archetype medium-sized office building model. The sensitivity of the simulation results with respect to three variables was studied: fault recurrence period, fault repair period, and discomfort threshold for simulated complaints. The results indicate that the energy use intensity and the predicted percentage of dissatisfied exhibit a power–law relationship with time, in which most of the performance reductions occur in the first 10 years. If the work-orders are issued only upon occupant complaints, the faults were estimated to cause a 16–62% increase in the energy use intensity for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning and a 11–38% increase in the predicted percentage of dissatisfied at the end of the 50-year simulation periods. The results indicate that if the faults can be detected within a month after their first appearance, almost all their detrimental effects on a building’s energy and comfort performance can be mitigated.'
