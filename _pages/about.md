* I am a Ph.D. Candidate and member of the [D3M Lab] (http://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca) in the department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. I am co-supervised by Professors Professors Scott Sanner and William Oâ€™Brien.

* My goal is to make the best residential heating, cooling, and ventilation (HVAC) system possible. One that understands its users, its surroundings and its opportunities for delivering comfort and/or savings. While HVAC represents 64% of residential energy consumption here in Canada, its operation has remained reliant on active and knowledgable users for its management - which often leads to suboptimal performance. I am utilizing the data generated from connected-thermostats, (i.e., thermostats with an active internet-connection) to develop insights and systems to address these inefficiencies by understanding how people use their thermostats, and how their homes perform/operate. Not just limited to a handful of devices, I am exploring the Donate Your Data dataset released by ecobee Inc. It contains over 25,000 thermostats, and represents an incredible new opportunity for studying this domain. I plan on utilizing state of the art methods including Bayesian models and neural nets at both the individual and community levels to build predictive applications including decision making and controls.
