2014-11-02,On adaptive occupant-learning window blind and lighting controls,Building Research & Information,"Occupants have a significant impact upon building energy use, e.g. through the actuation of window blinds and switching off lights. Automation systems with fixed set points for controlling blinds and lights have been used in some applications as an attempt to mitigate the impact of occupant behaviour upon energy consumption. A conceptual framework of an alternative control method is presented, one in which the control system adapts control set points in real time to each occupant's preferences. The potential of this hypothesis is demonstrated through a simulation-based study focused on a hypothetical south-facing office with existing empirical models that predict occupant behaviour regarding the control of window blinds and lights. The performance of a proposed adaptive automation system is simulated, one in which window-blind and lighting control set points are adapted in real time to learn the modelled occupant preferences using a Kalman filter. The performance of this alternative occupant-learning method of control is contrasted to that of two conventional control methods, one in which occupants have manual control over window blinds and lights, and the other that employs an automation system with fixed set points. The simulation results indicate that such an adaptive occupant-learning control method could lead to substantial energy savings.","Gunay, H. B., O'Brien, W., Beausoleil-Morrison, I., & Huchuk, B.

2014-05-01,Recursive thermal building model training using ensemble Kalman filters,"Ottawa, ON: eSim.","Simplified building models have gained in popularity as a result of their practical applications in model-based predictive control (MPC); however, these models require accurate parameter estimates in order to give meaningful results. To this end, this simulation-based study proposes a recursive parameter estimation methodology—the so-called Ensemble Kalman Filter—as a method for predicting effective resistance and capacitance values of an office space. Accuracy of the proposed methodology to predict the response of the simulated-building was studied. Results indicate that the proposed methodology resembles a promising approach to learn building physics in a self-adaptive manner using simple generic sensor/meter networks; lending itself to the controls practitioners.","Huchuk, B., Cruickshank, C.

2014-05-01,The effect of input uncertainty in model-based predictive control,"Ottawa, ON: eSim.","The adoption of model-based predictive control (MPC) strategies for building systems, such as auxiliary heating/cooling systems, electric lighting systems, operable window and window shading systems, represents a significant potential to reduce the environment impact of buildings. However, the potential of MPC has been challenged with the limited nature of the information available to the controller to make optimal operational decisions. This paper proposes a selfadaptive MPC method: one in which the control system (1) learns the building physics via a sequential non-linear filter—processing the data coming from a network of sensors/meters;(2) predicts its response using a first-order discrete-time state-space model—processing data coming from forecasts; and,(3) adapts the operation of a heating/cooling system by employing the Newton's method in optimization. The potential of this MPC method is demonstrated through a simulation-based study focused on a hypothetical south-facing office. The performance of the MPC method is contrasted to a classical reactive controller. Its sensitivity to varying resolution and availability of sensors, meters and forecasts is studied. The simulation results indicate that such a method could lead to significant energy savings, even with the limitations/challenges related with the availability and resolution of these inputs. Such a system may also enhance the controllability of the indoor climate within the designated setpoints.","Gunay, H., O’Brien, W., Beausoleil-Morrison, I., Huchuk, B., Palmer, M., Fletcher, J., & Pavlovski, A.

2016-05-18,Model-based predictive control of office window shades,Building Research & Information,"In the automation of interior window shading devices, a control system that relies on a prediction of environmental conditions and a building's thermal response can provide savings to space-conditioning loads beyond what can be achieved using a reactive approach. The development of these control strategies can be difficult because of the uniqueness of each building. A simplified model-based predictive control (MPC) method for window shades is proposed. To this end, a control-oriented model representing the heat transfer problem in a perimeter office space was developed. The parameters of the model were estimated using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). The energy-savings potential of the EnKF-based MPC approach for window shades was investigated using EnergyPlus simulations. This was accomplished by implementing the control-oriented model into the energy management system application of EnergyPlus. Simulations were conducted to assess the energy saving potential of using the EnKF-based MPC for roller blinds in a south-facing perimeter office space in Ottawa, Canada. The simulation-based results indicate the potential for about 35% reduction in electricity usage for space conditioning over manually operated interior roller blinds.","Huchuk, B., Gunay, H.

2013-04-07,Preliminary results of model predictive control of shading systems (WIP),Proceedings of the Symposium on Simulation for Architecture & Urban Design,"Shades in buildings are widely installed and are an effective technique for managing solar gains and occupant comfort. A model of a typical office space located in Ottawa, Ontario has been created and the model was developed for analysis under variable conditions. Analysis has resulted in the generation of an advanced reactive system facilitated by the use of the energy management system (EMS) built within EnergyPlus along with a predictive control system optimized for the minimizing of the energy demand by the office space. The approach to optimization is done through the use of a basic model predictive control facilitated by the use of MATLAB (Mathworks 2011) and EnergyPlus (DOE 2012). The predictive system at this stage is delivering reductions of 5% during shoulder season over its reactive counterpart but this work is still on-going.","Huchuk, B., O'Brien, W., & Cruickshank, C.

2014-12-01,Shortest-prediction-horizon model-based predictive control for individual offices,Building and Environment,"When employing model-based predictive control (MPC) for zone level heating and cooling systems, in many cases weather forecasts were imported to predict a thermal zone's temperature response over a time horizon. However, an office's thermal response is strongly influenced by an occupant's presence and behaviours. As illustrated through the analysis of an EnergyPlus simulation, propagation of the uncertainty introduced by an occupant's presence and behaviours into the temperature response of a thermal zone can result in suboptimal control decisions when the prediction time horizon extends beyond one hour. Results indicate that modest, yet robust to occupant behaviour, energy savings can be achieved by limiting the prediction time horizon to one hour in zone level MPC implementations. Choice of this prediction time horizon also eliminated the need for importing weather forecasts. In an effort to discuss the implementation challenges, this MPC algorithm has been implemented in a commercial controller to automate a ceiling radiant panel heater and a variable-air-volume (VAV) terminal unit serving to a west-facing office in Ottawa.","Gunay, H.

14-Jul,Model-based predictive control of window shades,Thesis,"As architecture and engineering push the boundaries of what is possible with highlyglazed façades, the traditional approach of leaving shading control up to active occupants becomes a larger energy burden. Shades, if operated correctly, can provide substantial reductions both to the space conditioning loads of the building and its lighting use. Because of the delayed thermal response to solar gains, predictive controls are beneficial.","Huchuk, B. J.

2018-01-01,A Preliminary Study on Text Mining Operator Logbooks to Develop a Fault-Frequency Model,ASHRAE Transactions,"In this study, the framework for a transferable model-based predictive controlled shading solution is laid out. The analysis began with a numerical investigation into thermal model training using a Bayesian approach—namely the Ensemble Kalman Filter—for calibrating a low-order control model of the space. The trained model had its effectiveness demonstrated and was successfully utilized within the EnergyPlus environment to control the shades of single zone office and provide total electricity savings of 35% in a complete building automation system. Later, these methodologies were adapted and utilized in a demonstrative setting built within a research facility to attempt and identify the challenges associated with the scaling of the approach. The results showed an environment which effectively managed occupant needs both visually and thermally and which ultimately was found to save energy in comparison the previously existing system in the building.","Shi, Z., Weiming Shen PhD, P., & Huchuk, B.

2018-07-01,"A longitudinal study of thermostat behaviors based on climate, seasonal, and energy price considerations using connected thermostat data",Building and Environment,"While previous studies have attempted to understand and predict users' behaviors and preferences for residential thermostats, they have been restricted by a lack of available data. Because of practical constraints, researchers previously relied on short observation periods, small sample groups, and/or participants close in physical location. The advent of the connected thermostat and its inherent centralized data collection now allows for such studies to be performed without the onus of data collection. Specifically, in this article we focus on the ‘Donate Your Data’ dataset made available by the thermostat manufacturer ecobee Inc. The dataset, consisting of more than 10,000 connected thermostats installed across North America and spanning multiple years, was used to investigate how users' comfort decisions are affected by exterior stimuli such as climate regions, seasonal patterns, and utility rates. Our analysis indicates that seasonality and climate region affected user preferences while utility rates did not contribute to meaningful variation in behavior. Further investigation explored if behavioral user types could be identified based on variation in occupied and unoccupied setpoints, thermostat overrides with holds, or heating and cooling setpoint selection. We did not find distinct user clusters to be identifiable based on any of the metrics; rather, occupant behavior in the population appeared to span more of a continuum across each metric.","Huchuk, B., O'Brien, W., & Sanner, S.

2018-04-17,Energy and comfort performance benefits of early detection of building sensor and actuator faults,Building Services Engineering Research and Technology,"This paper presents a building performance simulation-based investigation to better understand the energy and comfort performance benefits of early detection of common sensor and actuator faults. Five types of air-handling unit faults and four types of zone-level faults were implemented to the energy management system application of the building performance simulation tool EnergyPlus. During 50-year simulation periods, the faults were randomly permitted to affect 75 different components of an archetype medium-sized office building model. The sensitivity of the simulation results with respect to three variables was studied: fault recurrence period, fault repair period, and discomfort threshold for simulated complaints. The results indicate that the energy use intensity and the predicted percentage of dissatisfied exhibit a power–law relationship with time, in which most of the performance reductions occur in the first 10 years. If the work-orders are issued only upon occupant complaints, the faults were estimated to cause a 16–62% increase in the energy use intensity for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning and a 11–38% increase in the predicted percentage of dissatisfied at the end of the 50-year simulation periods. The results indicate that if the faults can be detected within a month after their first appearance, almost all their detrimental effects on a building’s energy and comfort performance can be mitigated.","Gunay, B., Shen, W., Huchuk, B., Yang, C., Bucking, S., & O’Brien, W.

2019-05-01,Comparison of machine learning models for occupancy prediction in residential buildings using connected thermostat data,Building and Environment,"Occupancy detection capabilities provided by modern connected thermostats enable adaptive thermal control of residential buildings. While this adaptation might simply consider the current occupancy state, a more proactive optimized system could also consider the probability of future occupancy in order to balance comfort and energy savings. Because such proactive control relies on accurate occupancy prediction, we comparatively evaluate a number of machine learning models for predicting measurements of the future occupancy state of homes that is critically enabled by thermostat data from real households in ecobee's Donate Your Data program. We consider a variety of models including simple heuristic and historical average baselines, traditional machine learning classifiers, and sequential models commonly used for time series prediction. We evaluate the performance of each model according to temporal, behavioural, and computational efficiency characteristics. Our key overall finding is that the random forest algorithm matched or outperformed the other candidate models, had consistently high accuracy predicting over a range of time horizons, and is relatively efficient to train for individual “edge” devices."," Huchuk, B., Sanner, S., & O'Brien, W.
